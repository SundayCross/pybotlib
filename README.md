# What is pybotlib?
pybotlib is a high level library for creating business oriented Robotic Process Automations using Python 2.7.15. 
It is recomended to run on a Windows client but will also function on Mac OS.

Aimed at outperforming and outcosting closed sourced solutions such as Automation Anywhere or Blueprism, pybotlib consists of a central wrapper around the selenium webdriver exposing highly customized methods and functions through an efficient and easy to use API.

The package's goal is to facilitate the RPA development process and bring Python into the Intelligent Automation and Robotic Process Automation industries.

Some conveniences  provided are:
 - Robust methods to navigate business applications frontends oriented towards efficiently managing large scale Automation endeavors
 - RPA logging locally hosted or integrated with Google Cloud StackDriver (coming soon)
 - Integration with SAP scripting client (coming soon) (Windows only)
 - Documentation and examples to create robust enterprise grade RPAs using python
 - Integration with major platforms for task specific business process automation

## Getting Started


 0) First download or clone the repo and cd into the directory. Make sure Python27 is installed.

 1) Install necessary packages by running the pip command with provided requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Make sure Google Chrome is installed on the host machine. Be prepared to run the CheckCDriver function provided in the library in order to download the most recent chrome webdriver for process automation. Running the following code will download the latest chromedriver and customize extensions optimized for RPA development:
 ```
from pybotlib.utils import CheckCDriver
# Checks if Google Chrome Driver is found on machine. Downloads if needed.
CheckCDriver()
```

3) You are now ready to use the package. Import the my_RPA class with the following code:
```
from pybotlib import *
```

## Example Robot

I have provided an example robot named investigator_RPA.py. This bot will lookup relevant news articles for specific topics provided in a list. Once completed all the steps above run the following lines of code to execute the robot. Feel free to edit and customize the robot on your machine!

```
python investigator_RPA.py
```

## Quick Start

To create an instance of an active RPA we must instantiate the my_RPA class. The instance will be the central object in our workflow and process automation.


```
human_resources_bot = my_RPA(bot_name="HR_bot", downloads_directory="timesheets")
human_resources_bot.create_log_file()
human_resources_bot.initialize_driver()
human_resources_bot.log("WebDriver Initiated")
```

A common issue in process automation is being able to efficiently identify specific elements within an html front end.

Ideally this should be done with the least lines of code possible.

This is why we have created the find_by_tag_and_attr method that iterates through every single element of a specific tag on a page and evaluates if any of the elements attributes matches the evaluation string provided. Matched elements are returned in a list.
```
my_robot = my_RPA(bot_name="my_robot", downloads_directory="my_robot_downloads_folder")
my_robot.find_by_tag_and_attr(tag, attribute, evaluation_string, sleep_secs)
```
